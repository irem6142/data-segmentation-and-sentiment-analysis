# Web Scraping

Web scraping is the process of automatically collecting data from a website. This process is carried out using software or bots to extract and analyze specific information. Web scraping can be applied in various fields, for example:

1. **Data Collection and Analysis:** Price comparison websites gather product information from e-commerce platforms to provide comparisons for users.

2. **Market Research:** Companies collect information about products, prices, and other marketing strategies from competitors' websites.

3. **Academic Research:** Researchers use web scraping to collect large datasets for their studies.

4. **News Aggregation:** Articles and news from various news websites can be automatically gathered and compiled.

Web scraping typically involves several basic steps:

1. **Connecting to the Website:** An HTTP request is sent to the target website.

2. **Retrieving HTML Code:** The HTML content of the webpage is fetched.

3. **Processing HTML:** The HTML code is parsed, and the target data elements are selected (e.g., specific tags or classes).

4. **Extracting Data:** The parsed data is extracted and structured (e.g., saved into a database or CSV file).

Some commonly used tools and libraries for web scraping include:

1. **BeautifulSoup:** A popular HTML and XML parsing library for Python.

2. **Scrapy:** A powerful web scraping framework based on Python.

3. **Selenium:** A tool used to automate web browsers, ideal for handling dynamic content.

4. **Puppeteer:** A Node.js library that provides browser automation by controlling Google Chrome.
