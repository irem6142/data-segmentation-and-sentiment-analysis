# Web Scraping
Web scraping is the process of automatically collecting data from a website. This process is carried out using software or bots to extract and analyze specific information. Web scraping can be applied in various fields, for example:

Data Collection and Analysis: Price comparison websites gather product information from e-commerce platforms to provide comparisons for users.

Market Research: Companies collect information about products, prices, and other marketing strategies from competitors' websites.

Academic Research: Researchers use web scraping to collect large datasets for their studies.

News Aggregation: Articles and news from various news websites can be automatically gathered and compiled.

Web scraping typically involves several basic steps:

Connecting to the Website: An HTTP request is sent to the target website.

Retrieving HTML Code: The HTML content of the webpage is fetched.

Processing HTML: The HTML code is parsed, and the target data elements are selected (e.g., specific tags or classes).

Extracting Data: The parsed data is extracted and structured (e.g., saved into a database or CSV file).

Some commonly used tools and libraries for web scraping include:

BeautifulSoup: A popular HTML and XML parsing library for Python.

Scrapy: A powerful web scraping framework based on Python.

Selenium: A tool used to automate web browsers, ideal for handling dynamic content.

Puppeteer: A Node.js library that provides browser automation by controlling Google Chrome.
